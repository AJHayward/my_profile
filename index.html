        <h2>Learning and Development üìê</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
          Learning and Development, either within the corporate or educational environment, is responsible for identifying potential skills gaps and then offering learning initatives that will meet these needs. Development of learning material in various modalities, training, assessing and post evaluation of the learning journey all fall within the realm of learning and development.

        <h2>LMS & Instructional Design üíª</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
          As the world evolves and economies grow, the need for accessible and interactive material increases. this is especially true within the learning environment. Learning Management Systems which house engaging learning material, incorporating various forms of media, are becoming the go-to platforms for upskilling and education. The key is to address the immediate need in a manner that can be applied in the real world.

        <h2>Employee Engagement üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
          There is nothing more destructive to a workplace culture that a disengaged or disgruntled employee. A staff member can have all the necessary skills and expertise, but if they feel they are being undervalued or that their efforts are not beign recognised, they will not actively strive to achieve goals or growth opportunities. Engagement goes beyond monetary rewards, but also includes opportunities for self-development and career growth.
